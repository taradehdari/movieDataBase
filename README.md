# Introduction

This application uses API from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) to create a movie website. On the website you can search for movies and then click on the movie to get more information. The information given is plot, rating, directors, running time, budget, revenue and actors. To go back to the home page you can click on home at the top right or the react movie logo on the top right as well.  

## Getting stared with Create React App

Created application using React:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

[Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

[React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Node.js and npm if not already installed.
3. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
4. Start the development server with `npm start`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
